            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>But it is objected by you, and in a Booke called Mr.
<hi>Robin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that thu</hi> Hearing aforeſaid, <hi>is but a Morall act, and not Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion: and that Preaching the Word is not incloſed with any ditch, or hedge, human or divine, but lyes in common for all, and for the good of all,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>To which I Anſwer. Firſt, it is the Scripture onely that is of Divine and Conſcience-binding Authority, and no humane Authority, which only is the Argument from that Book.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, All that he aymeth at and indeavours to prove, is that one fully Seperated from the Church State of <hi>England,</hi> may beare the Miniſters therof without <hi>communion</hi> with them, which Argument is not for thoſe that are not Seperated there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, his Argument to prove it no <hi>communion,</hi> becauſe it is not <hi>rightfull communion,</hi> is not good; for unmarryed perſons can have adulerous marriage communion, though not
<hi>right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full:</hi> 
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:18457:7"/>they may not, nor ought not; yet they can, and too oft have <hi>communion</hi> appropriat to Marriage.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the whole and fole profeſſed ſcope of that Book, is to prove it lawfull for thoſe of his Church, or the like Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perates, to Heare the Miniſters of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which is expreſt in his Title thereof: but that point he never toucheth in his whole Booke after, either in generall, or by any particular affirmation, or poſitive proofe: but onely anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth one onely Argument, framed by himſelfe: as if it were the onely Argument, that had been, or could be brought to diſprove his Title and opinion; whereas there are many other, ſome of which I intend to ſhew you.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, ſince his writing that Booke, he publickly profeſſed and taught in the Church of <hi>Layden,</hi> whereof he was Miniſter, that this <hi>Hearing</hi> now in difference between us, was
<hi>partaking,</hi> and <hi>ſinfull partaking</hi> with a <hi>falſe Miniſtry,</hi> but not proper <hi>commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion therewith:</hi> and he was alſo then confuted therein, in the preſence of neare 300. perſons of that Church, and divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and promiſed to deſiſt from proſecuting that opinion, which he had made known.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, that Booke was never Printed, nor intended for to be, by himſelfe (though he lived at leaſt a yeare after the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thereof) nor by the Church whereof he was; nor any of the like true State; nor with their conſent: but an enemy of them and him, long after his death, and much longer after his writing it, having found it amongſt his waſt papers; and I think not knowing of Mr. <hi>Robinſons</hi> own aboveſaid revocation of the Title and ſcope of that Booke: and being urged by his and their moſt inveterate enemies, got it Printed to Mr. <hi>Robinſons</hi> Friends ſhame, and many mens hurt, who were willing to be hurt thereby in their <hi>ſouls,</hi> and matter of <hi>divine worship,</hi> rather then they would be hurt in their worldly <hi>repute</hi> and <hi>wealth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Seventhly, it is evident to the many that heard Mr.
<hi>Robinſons</hi> ſaid aſſertion, that this <hi>Hearing was ſinfull partaking with that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry:</hi> and the Arguments that prevailed with him ſo to ſpeak in the full Congregation of that great Church, that he wrote not that Book after it, becauſe there is no mention of any of thoſe Arguments which then diſwaded him from that ſecret opinion, which ſheweth that he honeſtly kept his promiſe of his deſiſting its proſecution; though it eſcaped the fire, which I thinke it ſhould not have done, if he, or his Friends had ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed it would have been Printed: for ever a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But to Anſwer thoſe Objections (but briefly.) Firſt, I deny not that it is meerly <hi>morrall,</hi> to <hi>ſpeake, heare, write, conferre,</hi> to <hi>wash, eate, drinke,</hi> &amp;c. yea even to
<hi>preach,</hi> or <hi>pray</hi> among <hi>morral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts:</hi> as when one preacheth the God of Nature to the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, which have no other State upon them but Nature, as <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.39.42. <hi>Act.</hi> 11.19,20. &amp; 17

Wherefore ſo to <hi>ſpeake, heare, washe, eate, drinke,</hi> as is aforeſaid, is more then <hi>morrall:</hi> becauſe then there is a <hi>prerogative precept,</hi> or an
